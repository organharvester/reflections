i am initializing 

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git directory where the git files can be stored.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?

The staging area is contained by the working directory and the git files are contained by it. It is valuable because it keeps the code
organized.
