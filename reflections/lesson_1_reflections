How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?

The diff progrom showed lines that had changed, so that it was
easier to find differences in the text.





How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If i could see the entire history of a file i could see the 
types of bugs that i make and would learn not to make them.
I could also see previous bits of code and re-use them.




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the
history of files?

If you use git log it shows you a list of all the differnt 
commits and a little line about what the change was, then 
you can use git diff and two of the ids (or the first 4chars) 
and it shows you the changes with "+" by the additions and 
"-" by the deletions.




How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that could break something?

if i saved a previous version i don't have to worry about 
any changes that will break the code because ill have a 
good version saved.
